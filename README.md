# Welcom to `c-nn`!
This is a repository made just for fun. I came up with the idea of realizing some basic linear algebra calculations using C and probably may be able to build a neural network out of the foundation.

Compile:

Windows:
```bash
c-nn % gcc -o ./exec_win/main main.c linalg.c xlinalg.c -lm
```

Mac:
```bash
c-nn % gcc -o ./exec_macos/main main.c linalg.c xlinalg.c -lm
```
